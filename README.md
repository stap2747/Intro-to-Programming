# Intro to Programming
 Shawn Stapel
 This repository is to hold my assignments while attending Southwest Tech
 I like to learn new things, and decided it would be useful to learn coding. This could lead to better employment, and is in general good to know. 
 I am taking this program to learn code. I want to be able to have an edge in the job market, and I think it would be useful to know.
